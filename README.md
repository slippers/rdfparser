rdfxml.py - An RDF/XML Parser in Python
=======================================

rdfxml.py is a standalone Python module in under 10KB that parses
RDF/XML using SAX. It was written to be used as a simple drop-in module
for larger projectsâ€”for when you just want the smallest and simplest
possible module to get the job done. Since it's standalone, it only
requires modules that are in the Python standard library; it doesn't
force you do download any RDF specific APIs etc. It's been released
under both GPL 2 and the W3C's software license.

The module is available as [rdfxml.py.txt](rdfxml.py.txt). Don't forget
to rename it to `rdfxml.py`. The file should have 228 lines and 9433
bytes. Its MD5 is ec83de4e97d4f7e8f05b1eb9dc14a0c1.

Ancillary Documentation
-----------------------

Documentation in the module itself is sparse, but there's not much to
know. The parser was written to conform to the [23 January 2003 RDF/XML
Syntax
Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20030123)
Working Draft; with the exception that bagID is no longer supported
since the RDF Core WG decided to remove it from the syntax.

It can be used as a command line tool: it takes a URI as the only
argument, and produces a list of NTriples. For example:-

<div class="pre">

<div>

\$ ./rdfxml.py http://infomesh.net/2003/rdfparser/meta.rdf

</div>

<div>

Otherwise, the only functions of concern to users are:-

`parseRDF(s, base=None, sink=None)`
:   Takes in a string s, and parses it as RDF/XML, calling the "triple"
    method on the sink with the subject predicate and object as the
    three arguments for each time a triple is found; try [the Sinks
    section](#sink) for more information. base gives the optional base
    URI of the input.

`parseURI(uri, sink=None)`
:   A wrapper that opens a URI with urllib first before passing the
    dereferenced content to the parseRDF function.

### Sinks

Sinks must be classes with a `triple(self, s, p, o)` method. s, p, and o
are Python strings corresponding to the subject, predicate, and object
productions of the of the
[N-Triples](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples) format's
[EBNF](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntrip_grammar). It is hoped
that this is a usable API-independent way of returning the terms of the
triples. Here's an example function that will return a list of (s, p, o)
tuples from a string containing RDF/XML:-

    import rdfxml

    class Sink(object): 
       def __init__(self): self.result = []
       def triple(self, s, p, o): self.result.append((s, p, o))

    def rdfToPython(s, base=None): 
       sink = Sink()
       return rdfxml.parseRDF(s, base=None, sink=sink).result

Note that terms may be str or unicode instances.

Rationale and Uses
------------------

This code was not written as a competitor to
[Eikeon](http://eikeon.com/)'s comprehensive RDF parser in his
[rdflib](http://rdflib.net/). I'm sure that his code has undergone a lot
more testing than this. This code was written simply because sometimes
you don't want to download an entire API when you just want a quick
hack. This is a good tool for when you just want triples quickly.

For example, [Ken MacLeod](http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/) has used
*rdfxml.py* in his
[foaf-check](http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/2003/06/24/foaf-check) FOAF
application. [Dan Brickley](http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/) appears to
want a version in Ruby for some project... (Having two users before it's
even been released is rather enjoyable.)

But Seriously... Why?
---------------------

I've been working on an RDF API for a while now. I needed an RDF/XML
parser for it, and so here it is. I've been building the API very
carefully, with the goal of making it *practical*. That is, I've only
worked on it when I've actually needed it for a project. In that way, I
think that it's become quite useful. It's still undergoing major
revision, though, so no public releases yet. You can mail me if you want
more information or a sneak preview.
